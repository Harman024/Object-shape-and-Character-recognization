#Optical-character-recognition
Using keras mnist dataset , 56x56 and 28x28 dimension images to train our ANN 7 layer model to get accuracy and loss.Run Optical character recognization.ipynb to know the accuarcy and time difference between model trained using 56x56 and 28x28 dimension images.

Regression model: get the time and accuracy of recognization of certain character.
